1. splice functionj syntax:

 	array.splice(where to add, how many to remove, what to add)

2. splice changes the array in original variable and gives the removed elements in its own variable

3. slice does not change the original array variable, and saves the sliced array in its own variable

	slice syntax:   array.slice(start index, end index) //end index is not included

4. only one argument in slice is starting index and output will give elements from that index to the end

5. other functions for arrays like: filter(), fuind(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), map(), reverse(), sort()

6. escape characters to manuplate strings 


7. Funcitons for string manipulation like : toLowerCase(), toUpperCase(), slice(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), charAt(), replace(), split()

8. indexOf() gives the index number of specidfied string inside bigger string, if not found return -1.

9. syntax indexOf("string to find index of", to find search from index)

10. lastIndexOf() is similar to indexOf() but difference is that lastindex starts search from last to first index

11. charAt() to get character at an index.

12. replace() replaces the character with given charcter
	syntax: replace(string to be replace, new string to place.
 It does not change orgininal variable

13. in replace(), only first string is replaced, in order to replace rest of duplicates of same string, put global flag /g with the string and remove the quotations like /hello/g,

14. Similarly, to replace similar strings with different cases, use i flag like /hello/i

16 split("character on which string will be divided") on string gives an array of that string with elements equal to the string characters divided at the provided character.


17 Math class has many functions for mathermatical operations

18. Math.round() , rounds off the values normally.

19 MAth.ceil() rounds off only to higher number like 5.6 to 6 and 5.3 to 6 as well.

20. Math.floor() rounds off to lower number only like 5.6 to 5 and 5.2 to 5 as well

21. MAth.random() gives number randomly between 0 to 1, excluding 1

22. other math functions like Math.pow(), Math.sqrt(), Math.abs(), Math.sin(), Math.cos(), Math.min(), Math.max(), Math.exp(), Math.log()

23. Math.toFixed(3) will round off the number to three decimal places

24. Date object gives current date and time according to that of your pc. It has many functions and its variable is initialized with new keyword like var dat = new Date()
