1. comparison operators and "&&", or "||", not"!"

2. if both conditions true then && wil give true

3. If any of the conditions is true the || will give true.

4. ! reverses result, like true to false and false to true

5. any number is true and zero is false, 

6. 6 is true !6 is false, !!6 is again true.

7. A number can be converted to boolean with ! sign

8. && and !! are called shortcuircit because if final result become apparent in mid of code then it does not executes the remaining code and returns the result.

9. These comparison operators are used in if-else and loops to set conditions
