1. comparison operators and "&&", or "||", not"!"

2. if both conditions true then && wil give true

3. If any of the conditions is true the || will give true.

4. ! reverses result, like true to false and false to true

5. any number is true and zero is false, 

6. 6 is true !6 is false, !!6 is again true.

7. A number can be converted to boolean with ! sign

8. && and !! are called shortcuircit because if final result become apparent in mid of code then it does not executes the remaining code and returns the result.

9. These comparison operators are used in if-else and loops to set conditions

10. FOllowing values will be FALSE in comparison operations, 
	Zero, undefined, null, NaN, ""(empty string) 

11. All values of string and numbers(except zero) will be TRUE in comparison.

12. Similarly if simple value is passed to the if else condiiton, it will be converted to TRUE/FALSE and ture will run if while false will run else code

13. Javascript for loop syntax 
	for (initialization ; condition till loop will run; expression){code to run}

14. above mentioned for loop condiitons are optional. If no condition is given in loop, it will run forever.

15. break: expression inside a loop is used to exit the loop

16. continue: expression is used inside loop to skip that specific iteration in whch loop is currently runnung and move to next iteration

17. objects {} can also be put in arrays. Any type of data can be placed in arrays

18 each element in arrays can be accesed through inex number. index number starts from 0

19 If element of array is called with index number that is not in array then undefined is returned

20 push function adds strings automatilcally to next index in an array. This is accessing data in Stack form

21 pop function will remove the last index value of array. its also stack form data access

22 shift function will remove an eklement at first index. its Queue data access method.

23. shift function will add an eklement at first index. its Queue data access method.
