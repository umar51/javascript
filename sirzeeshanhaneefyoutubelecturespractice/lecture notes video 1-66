Till Video 11:

Compiler vs INterpreter
	Compiler converts whole programs code to machine code and dhows error aftward execution. Its faster than interpreter.

	Interpretor convert one line by line until error arives and it stops there. Its slower


	COmpiler converts source code to machine and then gives output

	interpreter converts source directly to machine code.


Till video 20:

DOM is html of webpage


AJAX 

	Asynchronous Javascript and xml

	xmlhttps request is object created to communicate with server on background. 


TIll video 31

	Node.js is used for both server side and UI development.


Video 32 - 45:

	nodejs is server side as well as ui language, it runs without browser.
	To run js file in node, in terminal enter 'node filename'
	console.log will give output only in node, not in browser. 
	
	alert and document.write is only for browser.
	
	To run console.log in node, donot include alert or document.write in that code file, it will give error in node. 

	To write ' inside string, use " " , for " use ''

	NUll and undefined means no value assigned

	when variable is initialized and no value is assigned to it then javascript automatically assigns undefined to it

	Null is assigned by user.


Video 46-60

	any data type can be stored in a var.

	All of the instructions by coder in code are Statements. ; semicolon at end of each colon. Javascript also considers newline as end of 		previous line statement


	Statements are consist of expressions like in statement x=a+b; a+b is one statement

	VAriable names show consist of aphabets, numbers, underscore _ and dollar sign $.

	1st letter can only be alphabet, dollarsign and underscore.NUmber cannot be 1st letter.

	The keywords reserved for javascript syntax cannot be used individually as variable name, eg. for, while, in print etc. They can be 		used in combonition, like while$


	javascript is case sensitive language. name row is not equal to rOw. 


	Use camel case for names with more than one word like firstName, ageTen

	Order of arthematic calculations
	BODMAS Brackets > Order(powers) > Divide > Multiplication > Addition > Subtraction 
	

	in a++; ++ is uniary operator as it requires only one var to operate

	increment or decrement operator can be used prefix or postfix. c= ++a, prefix increment here a increases and then saves into c
	c=a++ postfix incremnt, it increase the original variable but saves old value of a into c


	A number added to a string concatinates it into string


Video 61-

	Prompt input saves values as string, if input is 5 and you add 5 to it within prompt it will display 55. its concatinated as string
	
	If user doesnot enter any value at the prompt then prompt display the default value passed into prompt() as 2nd argument

	NAN means not a number

	parseint() converts a string to int. If string doesnot have number it returns NaN. If 5.1 is passed to parseint() it is converted to 		integer which 5

	parsefloat() converts a string to float. If string doesnot have number it returns NaN.

	Number() converts a string to number(integer and float). If string doesnot have number it returns NaN.

	Comparison operaters '==' and '===' perform similary function but the difference is that == does consider the data type i.e. '5'==5 		will return true but '5'===5 will return false because '===' also considers the data type
